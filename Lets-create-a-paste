# PREWARNING DO NOT SPAM THIS
# Or it could get u banned from api on website
# So this is another basic script but this time we are creating a hastebin paste via requests

import requests # pip install requests / sudo pip install requests

# First lets go to https://www.toptal.com/developers/hastebin/
# Now go to inspect element then find network tab
# We are going to write something random into paste and save it
# Make sure network is recording for requests!

# You will see a request pop up the url should be something like this
# https://www.toptal.com/developers/hastebin/documents
# We can also see it uses a post request.

# If we scroll down we see a payload this can be json at times or data
# We are now going to code this up

resp = requests.post("https://www.toptal.com/developers/hastebin/documents", data=input("Content: ")) # so we send a post request since request we recieved was a post.
# We put  data= For payload but sometimes it can be json=

link = resp.json()["key"] # This recieves json request this can be seen if you press preview in network tab
# So it goes through json layout and finds variable called key and tells us it

link = "https://www.toptal.com/developers/hastebin/" + link # This is setting format of link so we know where our paste will be
print(link) # Displays it to our screen
